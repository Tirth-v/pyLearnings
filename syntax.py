# Indentation :
"""
    Indentation in python is very important.
    Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of the code.
    Usually most common indentation is four spaces but we will need to do atleast one space.
    We have to use same number of spaces in the same block of code oherwise python will give us an error.
