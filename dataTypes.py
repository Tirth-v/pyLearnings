# Data types

"""
    * type() function : To check data type of any variable.
    
    Datatype : In python data types are considered as 
               classes and the variables we create those
               are known as an instance or an object of that class.

               eg. var1 = 3
                   print(type(var1))
                   o/p : <class 'int'>
                            (Here var1 is an object of the class 'int')


            - Data types represents the type of data stored
              into a variable or memory.

"""

# Two types of datatypes :

"""
    1. Built-in datatype
    2. User defined datatype



    1. Built-in datatypes :
        - These datatypes are already defined by python.
        => Built-in datatypes :
            - None type
            - Numeric type
                - int
                - float
                - complex number
            - Dictionary
            - Boolean
            - Set
            - Sequence datatype
                - String
                - List
                - Tuple

"""

# None type :

"""
    - None datatype represents an object that does'nt contain any value.\
    eg. a = None
        print(type(a))
        o/p : <class 'NoneType'>

"""

# int type :

"""
    - Integer datatype represents whole nunmbers(positive/negative)
    ...-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3...

"""

# float type :
"""
    - Float type represents floating point numbers(positive/negative)
    ...-1.0,0.1,1.0,...

"""

# complex type :

"""
    - Complex number are written with "j" as the imaginary parth
    - Used in many applications like
        - Signal processing
        - Algebra
        - Physics

    - eg. x = 1+2j

"""

# Boolean type :

"""
    - Data type with one of the two built-in values,
      True or False.
    - True and False with capital 'T' and 'F' are valid
      booleans otherwise python will throw an error.

"""

# Remaining datatypes are included seperately to other files.
